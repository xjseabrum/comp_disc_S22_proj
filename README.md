# Computational Models of Discourse Final Project:  Unsupervised Approaches to the PDTB
This final project showcases my abilities to implement unsupervised approaches to PDTB 2.0.  The motivation behind this is to determine a possible cause as to why the best neural models on predicting the PDTB 2.0 tag aren't garnering an accuracy metric better than 55%. The final project report can be found in the file called ".pdf"

# Class Description and Syllabus
The class (which I took under Alexis Palmer at CU Boulder in Spring 2022) went over many topics regarding how discourse is modelled computationally.  Topics include: Theories of Discourse, Discourse coherence, Coreference resolution, RST and PDTB, chatbots, and dialogue systems. The syllabus can be found here: "CompDiscSyllabus.PNG"

# Files
As of May 10, 2022, the Google Colab notebook that Cutter, Marie, Weitung, and I worked on is available in this repository. Eventually, I plan to update and convert the ipynb file to a Python file. Additionally, I plan to clean the ipynb file to showcase just the final models that are reported on in the latest version of the report.
